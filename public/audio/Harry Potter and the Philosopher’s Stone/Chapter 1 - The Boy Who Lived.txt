**English:** Chapter 1. The boy who lived. Mr. and Mrs. Dersley of number four Private Drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal. Thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dersley was the director of a firm called Grunnings which made drills. He was a big beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dersley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors. The Derslley's had a small son called Dudley. And in their opinion, there was no finer boy anywhere. The Derslley's had everything they wanted. But they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dersley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years. In fact, Mrs. Dersley pretended she didn't have have a sister because her sister and her goodfor-no husband were as undersley-ish as it was possible to be. The Derslley's shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street. The Derslley's knew that the potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away. They didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that. When Mr. and Mrs. Dersley woke up on the dull gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dersley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dersley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large toy owl flutter past the window. At 8, Mr. Dersley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dersley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye, but missed because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.
**Chinese:** 第 1 章。大难不死的男孩。住在水蜡树街 4 号的德思礼夫妇总是得意地说，他们是彻头彻尾的正常人，谢谢。他们是那种人们最不希望与任何奇怪或神秘事物有牵连的人，因为他们根本不相信那些胡言乱语。德思礼先生是一家名为“古农”的公司的董事，该公司生产钻机。他是一个体型魁梧的壮汉，脖子短得几乎没有，但他留着很大的小胡子。德思礼太太身材瘦削，一头金发，脖子的长度几乎是常人的两倍，这在她探头越过花园栅栏，监视邻居时非常有用。德思礼夫妇有个小儿子叫达力。在他们看来，没有哪个孩子比达力更优秀了。德思礼夫妇拥有一切他们想要的东西。但他们也有一个秘密，他们最害怕的就是有人会发现它。他们认为，如果有人发现了波特一家的事情，他们将无法忍受。波特太太是德思礼太太的姐姐，但他们已经多年没有见面了。事实上，德思礼太太假装自己没有这个姐姐，因为她的姐姐和她那个不成器的丈夫是和德思礼夫妇完全不搭调的人。德思礼夫妇一想到波特一家出现在这条街上，邻居们会说什么，就不寒而栗。德思礼夫妇知道波特一家也有个小儿子，但他们从未见过他。这个男孩是让他们避开波特一家的另一个好理由。他们不想让达力跟那样的孩子混在一起。当德思礼夫妇在这故事开始的那个阴沉灰暗的星期二醒来时，外面多云的天空没有任何迹象表明，奇怪而神秘的事情很快就会在全国各地发生。德思礼先生哼着歌，挑选着他最无聊的一条领带去上班，德思礼太太则开心地聊着天，同时费力地把尖叫着的达力塞进他的高脚椅里。他们谁也没注意到一只大个的玩具猫头鹰从窗户旁飞过。八点钟，德思礼先生拿起公文包，亲了亲德思礼太太的脸颊，并试图亲吻达力说再见，但没有成功，因为达力正在发脾气，把他的麦片扔向墙壁。

**English:** Little Tikeke, chled Mr. Dersley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive. It was on the corner of the street. street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar. A cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dersley didn't realize what he had seen. Then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabbyat standing on the corner of Private Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dersley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dersley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Private Drive. No, looking at the sign. Cats couldn't read maps or signs.
**Chinese:** “小坏蛋，”德思礼先生离开家时喊道。他上了车，倒出了四号的私家车道。就在街角，他注意到了第一件奇怪的迹象。**一只猫在看地图**。有一秒钟，德思礼先生没有意识到自己看到了什么。然后他猛地把头转过去再看一眼。水蜡树街的角落里站着一只虎斑猫，但根本没有地图。他刚才在想什么呢？那一定是光线造成的错觉。德思礼先生眨了眨眼，盯着那只猫。那只猫也盯着他。当德思礼先生开车绕过街角上路时，他从后视镜里看着那只猫。它现在正**“阅读”**那个写着“水蜡树街”的路牌。不，是看着路牌。猫是不会读地图或路牌的。

****
**English:** Mr. Dersley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind as he drove towards town. He thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. Meanwhile, the recent decision, but on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about, people in cloaks. Mr. Dersley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes, the getups you saw on young people. He supposed was some stupid new fashion. He drumed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dersley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all. Why, that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emerald green cloak, the nerve of him. But then it struck Mr. Dersley that this was Probably some silly stunt. These people were obviously collecting for something. Yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dersley arrived in the Grunning car park, his mind back on drills. Mr. Dersley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owl. swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did. They pointed and gazed, open-mouthed, as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl, even at nighttime. Mr. Dersley, however, had a perfectly normal owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people.
**Chinese:** 德思礼先生摇了摇头，在驾车驶向镇上时，把那只猫的事情抛在了脑后。他心里只想着那天希望能拿到的一大批钻机订单。与此同时，这个最新的决定，但在镇的边缘，钻机的事情又被其他事情赶出了他的脑海。当他坐在早晨常见的交通堵塞中时，他禁不住注意到周围似乎有很多穿着奇装异服的人，**穿着斗篷的人**。德思礼先生受不了穿奇怪衣服的人，就是你在年轻人身上看到的那种打扮。他猜想这又是一种愚蠢的新时尚。他用手指敲击着方向盘，目光落在了附近聚集的一群怪人身上。他们正兴奋地低声交谈着。德思礼先生愤怒地发现他们中有几个人根本就不年轻。瞧，那个人肯定比他年纪大，却穿着一件**翠绿色的斗篷**，他真是胆大包天。但接着德思礼先生想到，这可能只是一些愚蠢的宣传噱头。这些人显然是在为某个活动募捐。是的，肯定是这样。交通移动了，几分钟后，德思礼先生到达了古农公司的停车场，他的心思又回到了钻机上。德思礼先生在他的九楼办公室里总是背对着窗户坐着。如果不是这样，他那天早上可能会更难集中精力在钻机上。他没有看到猫头鹰在**大白天里俯冲飞过**，尽管街上的人们看到了。他们张大了嘴巴，指着、盯着，一只接一只的猫头鹰从头顶飞过。他们中的大多数人即使在晚上也从未见过猫头鹰。然而，德思礼先生度过了一个完全正常的、没有猫头鹰的上午。他对五个人大喊大叫。

****
**English:** He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunch. time when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakers opposite. He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large donut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying.
**Chinese:** 他打了几个重要的电话，又多喊了一会儿。他的心情一直很好，直到午餐时间，他想伸伸腿，走过马路到对面的面包店给自己买个小圆面包。他完全忘记了那些穿斗篷的人，直到他经过面包店旁边的一群人。他经过时愤怒地盯着他们。他不知道为什么，但他们让他感到不安。这群人也在兴奋地低声交谈，他看不到一个募捐箱。在他拿着一个大甜甜圈往回走时，经过他们身边时，他听到了他们说的一些话。

****
**English:** The porters. That's right. That's what I heard. Yes, their son, Harry. Mr. Dersley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost just finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking, "No, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name."
**Chinese:** “波特一家。没错。我听到的就是这个。是的，他们的儿子，**哈利**。”德思礼先生立刻停住了。恐惧淹没了他。他回头看着那些低语者，似乎想对他们说什么，但转念一想还是作罢。他冲过马路，跑回办公室，厉声叫秘书不要打扰他，抓起电话，几乎就要拨完家里的号码时，他改变了主意。他放下听筒，捋了捋自己的小胡子，心想：“不，他真是太傻了。**波特**这个名字又不是那么罕见。”

****
**English:** He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dersley. She always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her if he'd had a sister like that. But all the same, those people in cloaks. He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon. And when he left the building at 5:00, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dersley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that may passes by stare,
**Chinese:** 他确信有很多叫波特的人，他们的儿子叫哈利。仔细想想，他甚至不确定他的侄子叫不叫哈利。他从未见过那个男孩。也许叫哈维 (Harvey)，或者哈罗德 (Harold)。没必要让德思礼太太担心。一提到她姐姐，她总是心烦意乱。如果他有那样的妹妹，他也不会责怪她。但尽管如此，那些穿斗篷的人……那天下午，他发现自己更难集中精力在钻机上了。当他五点钟离开大楼时，他仍然心事重重，以至于刚走出门口就一头撞到了一个人身上。他咕哝了一声，那个矮小的老人踉跄了一下，差点摔倒。几秒钟后，德思礼先生才意识到那个人穿着一件紫罗兰色的斗篷。他看起来一点也不介意自己差点被撞倒在地。相反，他的脸上绽开了一个大大的笑容，他用一种尖细的声音说道，这让路过的人都盯着看：

****
**English:** "Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today. Rejoice, for you know who has gone and At last, even buggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy, happy day." And the old man hugged Mr. Dersley around the middle and walked off. Mr. Dersley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a **muggle**, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things. which he had never hoped before because he didn't approve of imagination. As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw, and it didn't improve his mood,
**Chinese:** “不用抱歉，我亲爱的先生，今天没有什么能让我不高兴。高兴吧，因为‘你知道是谁’终于消失了，**甚至像你一样的麻瓜**，也应该庆祝这个快乐、快乐的日子。”那老头拥抱了德思礼先生的腰，然后走开了。德思礼先生僵立在原地。他被一个完全陌生的人拥抱了。他还觉得自己被称作**麻瓜** (muggle)，不管那是什么意思。他心烦意乱。他匆忙走向自己的汽车，开车回家，希望自己只是在胡思乱想。这是他以前从未有过的希望，因为他一向不赞成想象力。当他把车开进四号的私家车道时，他看到的第一件事，并没有让他的心情好转，

****
**English:** was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one. It had the same markings around its eyes. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. "Was this normal cat behavior?" Mr. Dersley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs. Dersley had had a nice normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word.
**Chinese:** 就是他早上发现的那只虎斑猫。它现在正坐在他家的花园墙上。他确信是同一只。它眼睛周围有同样的斑纹。那只猫没有动。它只是严厉地看了他一眼。德思礼先生心想：“这是正常的猫的行为吗？”他努力让自己镇定下来，进了屋。他仍然决心不向妻子提起任何事情。德思礼太太度过了美好而正常的一天。她在晚餐时告诉他，隔壁太太的女儿出了什么问题，以及达力学会了一个新词。

****
**English:** Mr. Dersley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news. And finally, bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.
**Chinese:** 德思礼先生努力表现得正常。达力被哄上床后，他走进客厅，正好赶上晚间新闻的最后一条报道。“最后，世界各地的观鸟者都报告说，今天全国的猫头鹰行为非常反常。虽然猫头鹰通常在夜间捕猎，白天几乎看不到，但自日出以来，已经有数百次目击报告称这些鸟类正朝各个方向飞行。专家无法解释为什么猫头鹰会突然改变它们的作息习惯。”

****
**English:** The news reader allowed himself a grin. Most mysterious. And now over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim? Well, Ted, I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and D have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars. Perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early. It's not till next week, folks. But I can promise a wet night tonight."
**Chinese:** 新闻播报员露出了笑容。“太神秘了。现在请吉姆·麦古芬播报天气。吉姆，今晚还会下猫头鹰雨吗？”“嗯，特德，我不确定，但今天行为反常的不只是猫头鹰。远在肯特、约克郡和 D 地的观众都打电话告诉我，他们那里没有下我昨天承诺的雨，而是**下了一场流星雨**。也许人们提前庆祝了篝火之夜。各位，还有一周才到呢。但我可以保证今晚会是一个潮湿的夜晚。”

****
**English:** Mr. Dersley sat frozen in his armchair, shooting stars all over Britain, owls flying by daylight, mysterious people in cloaks all over the place, and a whisper, a whisper about the **potters**. Mrs. Dersley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. There was no for good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. "Um, but you dear, you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?" As he had expected, Mrs. Dersley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.
**Chinese:** 德思礼先生僵坐在扶手椅里，全英国的流星雨，白日飞行的猫头鹰，到处都是神秘的斗篷人，以及一个低语，一个关于**波特一家**的低语。德思礼太太端着两杯茶走进客厅。没有永远的逃避。他必须对她开口了。他紧张地清了清嗓子。“呃，亲爱的，你最近没有收到你姐姐的消息吧，对吗？”正如他所预料的，德思礼太太看起来既震惊又生气。毕竟，他们通常假装她没有这个姐姐。

****
**English:** "No. Why?" "Funny stuff on the news. Owls, shooting stars. And there were a lot of funnyl looking people in town today." "So," "well, I just thought maybe it was something to do with, you know, her a lot. Mrs. Dersley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dersley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name Potter. He decided he didn't dare. Instead, he said as casually as he could, "L son. He'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?" "I suppose so." "What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?"
**Chinese:** “没有。怎么了？”“新闻上有些奇怪的事情。猫头鹰，流星。今天镇上也有很多看起来很奇怪的人。”“所以呢？”“嗯，我只是想也许这和，你知道，她，有很大关系。”德思礼太太抿着嘴唇喝着茶。德思礼先生不知道自己是否敢告诉她，他听到了“波特”这个名字。他决定不敢。相反，他尽量随意地问道：“她那个儿子。他现在应该和达力差不多大了吧？”“我想是吧。”“他叫什么名字来着？霍华德 (Howard)，是吗？”

****
**English:** "Harry. Nasty. Common name if you ask me." "Oh, yes," said Mr. Dersley, his heart sinking horribly. "Yes, I quite agree." He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dersley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dersley crept to the bedroom. window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Private Drive as though it was waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the potters? If it did, if it got out that they were related to a pair of Well, he didn't think he could bear it. The Derslley's got into bed. Mrs. Dersley fell asleep quickly, but Mr. Dersley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last comforting thought before he fell asleep, was that even if the potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dersley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on.
**Chinese:** “**哈利** (Harry)。如果你问我，这是个令人讨厌的普通名字。”“哦，是的，”德思礼先生说，他的心可怕地沉了下去。“是的，我完全同意。”他们上楼睡觉时，他没有再提起这个话题。当德思礼太太在浴室里时，德思礼先生悄悄走到卧室窗前，朝前花园往下看。那只猫仍然在那里。它盯着水蜡树街，仿佛在等待着什么。他是产生幻觉了吗？所有这一切会不会和波特一家有关？如果有关，如果泄露出去他们和那样的一对夫妇有关系——他认为自己无法承受。德思礼夫妇上了床。德思礼太太很快睡着了，但德思礼先生却躺着醒着，在脑子里翻来覆去地想。在他睡着前的最后一个安慰性的想法是，即使波特一家卷入了其中，他们也没有理由靠近他和德思礼太太。波特一家非常清楚他和佩妮对他们以及他们那类人的看法。他看不出他和佩妮会如何卷入正在发生的任何事情。

****
**English:** He yawned. and turned over. It couldn't affect them. How very wrong he was. Mr. Dersley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Private Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car the door slammed in the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching. Appeared so suddenly and silently, you'd have thought he just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Private Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak, which swept the ground, and high heeled buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half moon spectacles, and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was **Albus Dumbledore**. Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rumaging in his cloak looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered.
**Chinese:** 他打了个哈欠，翻了个身。这不可能影响到他们。他大错特错了。德思礼先生可能正逐渐陷入不安的睡眠，但外面墙上的那只猫却丝毫没有睡意。它一动不动，像一座雕像，眼睛一眨不眨地盯着水蜡树街尽头的角落。当隔壁街有汽车车门砰地关上时，它没有颤抖，当两只猫头鹰从头顶俯冲而过时，它也没有颤抖。事实上，直到快到午夜时，这只猫才动了一下。一个男人出现在猫一直注视着的那个角落。他出现得如此突然和安静，你会以为他是从地里冒出来的。猫的尾巴抽动了一下，眼睛眯了起来。水蜡树街上从未见过像这个男人这样的人。他高个子，瘦削，而且非常老，从他银色的头发和胡须来判断，它们都长得足以塞进他的腰带里。他穿着长袍，一件拖到地上的紫色斗篷，和带扣的高跟靴。他那双蓝色的眼睛在他半月形眼镜后面闪闪发光，明亮而炯炯有神，他的鼻子很长，而且是歪的，好像至少被打断了两次。这个男人的名字叫**阿不思·邓布利多** (Albus Dumbledore)。阿不思·邓布利多似乎没有意识到，他刚刚来到一条从他的名字到他的靴子都会不受欢迎的街道。他正忙着在斗篷里翻找着什么东西。但他似乎意识到了自己正被监视，因为他突然抬头看向那只猫，那只猫仍然从街道的另一端盯着他。出于某种原因，看到那只猫似乎让他感到好笑。他咯咯地笑着，嘟囔道：

****
**English:** I should have known. He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again. The next lamp flickered in the darkness. 12 times he clicked. the put out her until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny pimp pricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beadyeyed Mrs. Dersley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the **Putoutter** back inside his cloak and set off down the street towards number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment, he spoke to it.
**Chinese:** “我就该知道。”他在内口袋里找到了他要找的东西。那似乎是一个银色的香烟打火机。他弹开它，举到空中，然后按了一下。最近的一盏路灯“砰”的一声灭了。他又按了一下。下一盏灯在黑暗中闪烁了一下。他按了 12 次，把它们都熄灭了，直到整条街上剩下的唯一灯光是远处两点微小的光点，那是那只猫盯着他的眼睛。如果现在有人从窗户往外看，即使是眼睛锐利的德思礼太太，也看不到人行道上发生的事情。邓布利多把这个**熄灯器** (Putoutter) 滑回他的斗篷里，沿着街道朝四号走去，他在墙上那只猫旁边坐了下来。他没有看它，但过了一会儿，他对它说话了。

****
**English:** "Fancy seeing you here, **Professor McGonagal**." He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead, he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She too was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn born into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. "How did you know it was me?" "My dear professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly." "You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day."
**Chinese:** “真高兴在这儿见到你，**麦格教授** (Professor McGonagal)。”他转身对着虎斑猫微笑，但它不见了。相反，他正对着一位看起来相当严肃的女士微笑，她戴着方框眼镜，形状与那只猫眼睛周围的斑纹一模一样。她也穿着一件斗篷，一件翠绿色的斗篷。她的黑发被梳成一个紧紧的发髻。她看起来明显很不安。“你怎么知道是我？”“我亲爱的教授，我从没见过一只猫坐得这么僵硬。”“如果你一整天都坐在砖墙上，你也会僵硬的。”

****
**English:** "All day? You could have been celebrating. I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here. Professor McGonagle sniffed angrily. Oh, yes. Everyone's celebrating. All right. You think they'd be a bit more careful. But no, even the muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news. She jerked her head back at the Dersley's dark living room window. I heard it. Flocks of owls shooting stars. Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent. I'll bet that was Deedless Diggle. He never had much sense.
**Chinese:** “一整天？你本可以去庆祝的。我来这里的路上一定经过了十几次盛宴和派对。”麦格教授气愤地抽了抽鼻子。“哦，是的。每个人都在庆祝。好吧。你会以为他们会更小心一点。但是没有，**连麻瓜都注意到了发生了一些事情**。这在他们的新闻里播了。”她向后扬了扬头，指向德思礼家黑暗的客厅窗户。“我听到了。成群的猫头鹰，流星。好吧，他们也不是完全愚蠢。他们一定会注意到一些事情。肯特郡的流星。我敢打赌那是迪迪勒斯·迪格尔干的。他从来就不太理智。”

****
**English:** "Oh, you can't blame them. We've had precious little to celebrate for 11 years. I know that. But that's no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless out in the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in muggle clothes, swapping rumors. She threw a sharp sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something. But he didn't, so she went on. A fine thing it would be if on the very day **you know who** seems to have disappeared, At last, the muggles found out about us all. Suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore.
**Chinese:** “哦，你不能怪他们。我们已经有 11 年没什么值得庆祝的事情了。”“我知道。但这不是我们失去理智的理由。人们在大白天里在街上简直是太粗心了，甚至没有穿麻瓜的衣服，互相交换着谣言。”她向邓布利多投去一个犀利的侧目，仿佛希望他能告诉她一些事情。但他没有，所以她继续说。“如果就在**‘你知道是谁’**似乎终于消失的这一天，麻瓜们发现了我们所有人的存在，那可真是太棒了。假设他真的走了，邓布利多。”

****
**English:** "It certainly seems so. We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a **sherbet lemon**?" "A what?" "Sherbet lemon. We're a kind of muggle sweet. I'm rather fond of." "No, thank you," said Professor McGonagle coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for sherbet lemons. "As I say, even if you know who has gone, My dear professor, surely a sensible person like yourself could call him by his name. All this **you know who** nonsense. For 11 years I've been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name. **Voldemort**."
**Chinese:** “看起来确实如此。我们有很多值得感激的事情。你想来一颗**爆炸柠檬** (sherbet lemon) 吗？”“什么？”“爆炸柠檬。这是一种麻瓜的糖果。我相当喜欢。”“不用了，谢谢，”麦格教授冷冷地说，仿佛她认为现在不是吃爆炸柠檬的时候。“正如我所说，即使‘你知道是谁’已经走了——我亲爱的教授，像你这样理智的人，当然可以直呼他的名字。所有这些**‘你知道是谁’**的胡言乱语。11 年来，我一直试图说服人们叫他真正的名字——**伏地魔** (Voldemort)。”

****
**English:** Professor McGonagal flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking to Sherpet lemons, seemed not to notice. "It will get so confusing if we keep saying you know who. I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying V. the Mo's name." "I know you haven't," said Professor McGonagle, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. "But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one you know." Oh, all right. **Voldemort was frightened of**. You flatter me. Voldemort had powers I will never have.
**Chinese:** 麦格教授颤抖了一下，但邓布利多似乎没有注意到，他正忙着吃爆炸柠檬。“如果我们一直说‘你知道是谁’，会变得非常混乱。我从来没有看到任何理由害怕说出伏——地——魔的名字。”“我知道你没有，”麦格教授说，语气中带着一半的恼火，一半的钦佩。“但你不同。每个人都知道你是唯一一个‘你知道是谁’——哦，好吧，**伏地魔害怕的人**。”“你过奖了。伏地魔拥有我永远不会拥有的力量。”

****
**English:** "Only because you're too well noble to use them." "Oh, it's lucky it's dark. I haven't rushed so much since Madame Potfrey told me she liked my new ear muffs. Professor McGonicle shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, "The owls are nothing to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying about why he's disappeared, about what finally stopped him." It seemed that Professor McGonagal had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss. The real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever everyone was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.
**Chinese:** “那只是因为你太过高尚而不愿使用它们。”“哦，幸好现在是晚上。自从庞弗雷夫人告诉我她喜欢我的新耳罩以来，我就没有这么脸红过。”麦格教授犀利地看了邓布利多一眼，说道：“那些猫头鹰跟四处流传的谣言比起来根本不算什么。你知道大家都在说他为什么消失，说是什么最终阻止了他。”看来麦格教授已经谈到了她最渴望讨论的重点。这是她一整天都在冰冷坚硬的墙上等待的真正原因，因为无论是作为一只猫还是一个女人，她都没有像现在这样用如此穿透性的目光盯着邓布利多。很明显，无论大家都在说什么，除非邓布利多亲口告诉她，否则她都不会相信这是真的。

**English:** Dumbledore, however, was choosing another sherbet lemon and did not answer. "What they're saying is that last night **Voldemort turned up in Codri's Hollow**. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are are that they are dead." Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagle gasped. "Hel and James. I can't believe it. I didn't want to believe it. Oh, Alus." Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. "I know. I know." Professor McGonogal's voice trembled as she went on.
**Chinese:** 然而，邓布利多正在挑选另一颗爆炸柠檬，没有回答。“他们说的是，昨晚**伏地魔出现在戈德里克山谷** (Codri's Hollow)。他去找到了波特一家。谣言是，莉莉和詹姆·波特——他们死了。”邓布利多低下了头。麦格教授倒吸了一口冷气。“莉莉和詹姆。我无法相信。我不想相信。哦，阿不思。”邓布利多伸出手，拍了拍她的肩膀。“我知道。我知道。”麦格教授的声音颤抖着，她继续说道。

**English:** "That's Not all. They're saying he tried to kill the potter's son, **Harry**. But he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why or how. But they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, **Voldemort's power somehow broke** and that's why he's gone." Dumbledore nodded glumbly. "It's It's True," faulted Professor McGonogal. "After all he's done, all the people he's killed. He couldn't kill a little boy. It's just astounding. Of all the things to stop him. But how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?"
**Chinese:** “还不止这些。他们说他试图杀死波特家的儿子，**哈利**。但他没有成功。他没能杀死那个小男孩。没人知道为什么，也不知道是怎么做到的。但他们说，当他杀不死哈利·波特时，**伏地魔的力量不知何故被打破了**，这就是他消失的原因。”邓布利多沮丧地点了点头。“这是……这是真的，”麦格教授结结巴巴地说。“在他做了所有那些事，杀了所有那些人之后。他却杀不了一个小男孩。这简直令人震惊。竟然是这件事阻止了他。但哈利到底是怎么活下来的？”

**English:** "We can only guess. We may never know." Professor McGonagal pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath their spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had 11 hands, but no numbers. Instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, "My grid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way."
**Chinese:** “我们只能猜测。我们可能永远不会知道。”麦格教授拿出一方蕾丝手帕，擦拭着眼镜下的眼睛。邓布利多用力吸了吸鼻子，从口袋里掏出一块金表查看。这是一块非常奇怪的手表。它有 12 根指针，但没有数字。相反，一些小行星正在边缘移动。不过，这对邓布利多来说一定是有意义的，因为他把它放回口袋里说：“**海格** (Hagrid) 迟到了。顺便说一下，我想是他告诉你会在这里的吧。”

****
**English:** "Yes. And I don't suppose You're going to tell me why you're here of all places." "I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now." "You don't mean You can't mean the people who live here," cried Professor McGonagle, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. "Dumbledore, you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son, a son. him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets. Harry Potter, come and live here."
**Chinese:** “是的。我想你不会告诉我你为什么偏偏来这个地方吧。”“我来是想把哈利带给他姨妈和姨父。他们是他现在仅有的家人了。”“你不是说……你不能是说住在这里的人吧，”麦格教授叫道，跳了起来，指着四号。“邓布利多，你不能这样做。我观察了他们一整天。你找不到两个比他们更不像我们的人了。他们还有这个儿子，一个儿子。他一路踢着他妈妈，尖叫着要糖果。哈利·波特，来住在这里？”

****
**English:** "It's the best place for him. His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter." "A letter?" Repeated Professor McGonicle faintly, sitting back down on the wall. "Really, Dumbledore? You think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him. He'll be famous. a legend. I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as **Harry Potter day** in future. There will be books written about Harry. Every child in our world will know his name."
**Chinese:** “这是对他最好的地方。等他长大后，他的姨妈和姨父就能向他解释一切。我已经给他们写了一封信。”“一封信？”麦格教授虚弱地重复道，重新坐回墙上。“真的吗，邓布利多？你觉得你能用一封信来解释这一切吗？这些人永远不会理解他。他会成为一个名人，一个传奇。如果将来这一天被称为‘**哈利·波特日**’，我都不会感到惊讶。会有关于哈利的书籍问世。我们世界上的每一个孩子都会知道他的名字。”

****
**English:** "Exactly," said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses. "It will be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk. Famous for something he won't even remember. Can't you see how much better off he'll be growing up away from all that until he's ready? could take it." Professor McGonagle opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, "Yes, yes, you're right, of course. But how's the boy getting here, Dumbledore?" She eyed his cloak suddenly, as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.
**Chinese:** “说得对，”邓布利多透过他的半月形眼镜顶部，非常严肃地说。“这足以让任何一个男孩冲昏头脑。在他会走路和说话之前就出名。为一个他甚至不记得的事情而出名。难道你看不出，在他准备好接受这一切之前，远离这一切成长会对他有多好吗？”麦格教授张了张嘴，改变了主意，咽了口口水，然后说：“是的，是的，你当然是对的。但是，邓布利多，这个孩子是怎么到这里的？”她突然盯着他的斗篷，仿佛认为他可能把哈利藏在下面。

****
**English:** "Hagrid's bringing him." "You think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?" "I would trust Hagrid with my life." "I'm not saying his heart, isn't it? in the right place. But you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to What was that? A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight. It swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky, and a **huge motorbike fell out of the air** and landed on the road in front of them. If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting a stride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild. Long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face. He had hands the size of dust bin lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.
**Chinese:** “**海格** (Hagrid) 正在带他过来。”“你认为把这么重要的事情托付给海格是明智的吗？”“我拿我的生命信任海格。”“我不是说他的心意不对。但你不能假装他不粗心。他总是倾向于——那是什么？”一阵低沉的隆隆声打破了周围的寂静。他们上下张望街道，寻找车头灯的迹象，隆隆声逐渐变大。当他们两人抬头望向天空时，隆隆声变成了咆哮，一辆**巨大的摩托车从空中坠落**，降落在他们面前的路上。如果说摩托车是巨大的，那么骑在它上面的男人更是如此。他几乎是普通人身高的两倍，宽度至少是五倍。他看起来简直大得有点不合常理，而且狂野不羁。一绺绺浓密的黑色乱发和胡须遮住了他大部分的脸。他的手有垃圾桶盖那么大，穿着皮靴的脚像小海豚一样。

**English:** In his vast, muscular her arms. He was holding a bundle of blankets. "Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. "At last. Where did you get that motorbike?" "Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore. Sir," said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. "Young **Sirius Black** lent it me. I've got him, sir. No problems, were there?" "No, sir. House was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the muggles started swarming around. He fell asleep as we was flying over Bristol."
**Chinese:** 在他宽大结实的臂弯里。他抱着一捆毯子。“海格，”邓布利多松了一口气地说。“终于来了。你从哪里弄来的摩托车？”“借来的，邓布利多教授，先生，”巨人一边说着，一边小心翼翼地从摩托车上爬下来。“是年轻的**小天狼星布莱克** (Sirius Black) 借给我的。我把他带来了，先生。没出什么问题吧？”“没有，先生。房子几乎被毁了，但在麻瓜们开始聚集之前，我把他安全带出来了。我们在飞过布里斯托尔时，他睡着了。”

****
**English:** Dumbledore and Professor McGonogal bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead, they could see a curiously shaped cut like a **bolt of lightning**. "Is that weird?" "Yes, you'll have that scar forever. Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?" "Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in useful. I have one myself about my left knee, which is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well, give him here, Hagrid. We better get this over with."
**Chinese:** 邓布利多和麦格教授俯身看着那捆毯子。里面隐约可见一个熟睡的男婴。在他额头上一绺乌黑的头发下面，他们可以看到一道形状奇特的伤口，**像一道闪电**。“那很奇怪吗？”“是的，你将永远带着那个伤疤。邓布利多，你就不能做点什么吗？”“即使我能，我也不会。伤疤有时很有用。我自己左膝上就有一个，是伦敦地铁的完美地图。好了，把他给我，海格。我们最好把这件事情办完。”

****
**English:** Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards the Derslley's house. "Could I could I say goodbye to him, sir?" He bent his great shaggy head over Harry. and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss. Then suddenly Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. "You wait then. Sorry," sobbed Hagrit, taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. "But I I can't stand it. Lily and James dead and poor little Harry off to live with muggles." "Yes. Yes. It's all very sad. But get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be frightened,"
**Chinese:** 邓布利多把哈利抱在怀里，转向德思礼的房子。“我，我能和他说声再见吗，先生？”他把他那巨大的、毛茸茸的头俯向哈利，给了他一个想必是扎人的胡须吻。然后海格突然发出了像受伤的狗一样的嚎叫。“你等着。对不起，”海格抽泣着，掏出一条大号的带斑点的手帕，把脸埋在里面。“但我……我受不了了。莉莉和詹姆死了，可怜的小哈利还要去和麻瓜一起生活。”“是的。是的。这一切都很悲伤。但控制住你自己，海格，否则我们会害怕的。”

****
**English:** Professor McGonogle whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm. As Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door, he laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute, the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle. Hagridge shoulders shook. Professor McGonagal blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out. "Well,"
**Chinese:** 麦格教授轻声说，小心翼翼地拍了拍海格的胳膊。邓布利多跨过低矮的花园墙，走向前门，他轻轻地把哈利放在门阶上，从斗篷里拿出一封信，塞进了哈利的毯子里，然后回到了另外两人身边。整整一分钟，他们三个人站在那里，看着这个小小的包裹。海格的肩膀在颤抖。麦格教授拼命地眨着眼睛，而平时从邓布利多眼中闪烁的光芒似乎也熄灭了。“好了。”

****
**English:** said Dumbledore finally. "That's that. We no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations." "Yeah, I'd best get this bike away. Good night, Professor McGonagal. Professor Dumbledore, sir." Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorbike and kicked the engine into life. With a roar, it rose into the air and off into the night. "I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonogal," said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagle blew her nose in reply.
**Chinese:** 邓布利多终于说道。“事情办完了。我们不该再留在这里了。我们不如去参加庆祝活动吧。”“好的，我最好把这辆摩托车弄走。晚安，麦格教授。邓布利多教授，先生。”海格用夹克袖子擦着泪流满面的眼睛，他翻身坐上摩托车，发动了引擎。伴随着一声轰鸣，它升到空中，消失在夜色中。“我很快就会再见到你的，麦格教授，我希望如此，”邓布利多对她点了点头。麦格教授以擤鼻涕作为回应。

**English:** Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner, he stopped and took out the silver **putoutter**. He clicked it once and 12 balls of light sped back to their street lamps. So the private drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. "Good luck, Harry." He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Private Drive. which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blanket without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by Mrs. ly scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. He couldn't know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to **Harry Potter, the boy who lived**.
**Chinese:** 邓布利多转身走回街上。在街角，他停下脚步，掏出了那个银色的**熄灯器**。他按了一下，12 个光球飞快地回到了它们的路灯上。水蜡树街突然亮起了橘色的光芒，他能看到一只虎斑猫溜溜达达地绕过街道另一端的角落。他正好能看到四号台阶上的那捆毯子。“祝你好运，哈利。”他转过身，斗篷一甩，就消失了。一阵微风吹乱了水蜡树街整齐的树篱。这条街道在墨色的天空下寂静而整洁，是最不可能发生惊人事情的地方。哈利·波特在毯子里翻了个身，没有醒来。一只小手抓住了身旁的信，他继续睡着，不知道自己是特殊的，不知道自己是著名的，也不知道他会在几个小时后被德思礼太太打开前门放牛奶瓶时的尖叫声吵醒，也不知道在接下来的几周里他会被他的表兄达力戳弄和捏掐。他不知道，就在这一刻，全国各地秘密聚会的人们正举起酒杯，低声向**“大难不死的男孩”哈利·波特**致敬。
